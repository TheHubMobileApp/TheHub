TheHub
======

The Hub - An app to facilitate hanging out with your friends.

TODO
----
- For the list should it be a api call to FB or to us since we will need their fb friends.
    - Could have a one time sync with facebook and then poll every so often to see if our names are the same as their friends list and if not change things.
    - Have button just in case (import fb friends)
    - Store list of user ids, go to fb to check if the same, then update list every time app is open again for the first time.
- Only show the view list button when you are logged in
